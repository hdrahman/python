# How to clone a git repo
git clone https://github.com/"user name"/python.git

git config --global user.email "email"
git config --global user.name ""

First program hello.py with parameters
prints length of array, first parameter. if the parameter is >=2 then it will be blank unless you add parameters when executing the code.

second program arraylooptesting.py 
This loop allows use to enter parameters as we want without having to go into the code and adjusting it so that it can except the new array lenght without causing an error and reduce the amount of code required for the same process

Third, fouth and fifth programs "Subtraction.py, addition.py, division.py"
These three programs function in a calculator like manner where it takes the two numbers that are entered when you run the program and then it finds the differemce, sum or quotient of the two numbers.
